Notes for EGL
=============

The EGL_PRIMITIVE class uses agents but uses an older Eiffel syntax for agents.
If compiled with EiffelStudio 16.05 the compiler reports 1 VUAR(2) error and 12
VJAR errors in the class EGL_PRIMITIVE. VJAR has to do with non compatible types
for agent assigments and VUAR has to do with how agent invocation is done.

This is due to two changes in the Eiffel syntax:

 a) EiffelStudio 15.08 introduced a new syntax to simplify calls to the features taking one tuple argument.

 b) One more major change in EiffelStudio 15.11 deals with routine classes (PROCEDURE, FUNCTION) which describe agents.

See: https://svn.eecs.yorku.ca/repos/sel-open/misc/tutorial/agents/docs/agents-simplified.html

This needs to be fixed but for now we can get away with adding the option 
"is_obsolete_routine_type="true"" to the .ecf file:


  <option warning="true" full_class_checking="true" is_obsolete_routine_type="true" void_safety="none"/>
