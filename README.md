EiffelOpenGL is an Eiffel wrapping of OpenGL. As of today it consists of incomplete but working wrappings of the GL and GLU libraries, as well as the GLUT library. It is licensed under EFL - The Eiffel Forum License.

A little history
----------------

This library was written in 1998-2002 in my spare time as a hobby project. I simply wanted to learn about graphics programming using OpenGL and I wanted to do it in Eiffel.

At that time I was working professionally on Windows and the main Eiffel development environment and compiler (ISE Eiffel - today Eiffel Software) was investing heavily in a presence on the Windows platform. Therefore it seemed natural for me to start working on EiffelOpenGL on Windows.

Since 2002 I haven't touched the library. The current library is thus completely geared towards Windows. This means that the configuration files (Ace-files) for each EiffelOpenGL program in the examples are written for the Windows platform.

Current status
--------------

On December 1, 2012, I moved the source code repository from SourceForge to GitHub. I am now making an effort to make sure all example programs and libraries work on Linux with the latest EiffelStudio compiler. I will not make any effort to ensure they work on Windows; however anyone wishing to help with that is welcome to do so.
