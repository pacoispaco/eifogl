EiffelOpenGL FAQ</h1>

<h3>
1. What is EiffelOpenGL?</h3>
EiffelOpenGL is the collective name for EGL, EGLUT and EGLAUX.
<ul>
<li>
EGL stands for <b>Eiffel</b> Open<b>GL</b> and is an Eiffel encapsulation
of OpenGL (ie. the GL and GLU libraries).</li>

<li>
EGLUT stands for <b>E</b>iffel <b>GLUT</b> and is an Eiffel encapsulation
of GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit library).</li>

<li>
EGLAUX stands for<b> E</b>iffel Open<b>GL AUX</b> and is an Eiffel encapsulation
of the OpenGL AUX (Auxillary) library.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
2. What inplementations of OpenGL, GLUT and GLAUX are supported?</h3>
Currently only the Microsoft Win32 OpenGl implementation and the GLUT 3.6
(<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~narobins/glut.html">http://www.cs.utah.edu/~narobins/glut.html</a>)
implementation for Windows NT &amp; 95. My goal is of course to have EGL
run smoothly on all important OpenGL and GLUT implementations.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
3. What do I need to use EiffelOpenGL?</h3>
To use EiffelOpenGL you need:
<ul>
<li>
The ISE Eiffel compiler and IDE. EiffelOpenGL was developed with ISE 4.2f,
but seems to work fine with ISE 4.5. At the moment EiffelOpenGL has some
dependencies on WEL (ISE Eiffels Windows Eiffel Library). These will be
removed in the near future. Since the semantics of the manifest string
in the language part of the Eiffel external clause isn't covered by ETL
or defined by NICE, it's interpretation depends upon what Eiffel compiler
you are using.</li>

<li>
To have installed the gl.h and glu.h include files and set your include
path so that your C compiler can find them.</li>

<li>
To have installed the opengl32.lib and glu32.lib import libraries, as well
as the opengl32.dll and glu32.dll dynamic libraries.</li>
</ul>
The Microsoft Win32 OpenGL implementation is for instance shipped with
Developer Studio 5.0 and 6.0. To use EGLUT you need, in addition to the
above mentioned:
<ul>
<li>
To have installed the glut.h include file and set your include path so
that your C compiler can find it.</li>

<li>
To have installed the glut32.lib import library as well as the glut32.dll
dynamic library.</li>

<li>
Compiled the eglut.lib (static) library.</li>
</ul>
To use EGLAUX you need, in addition to that needed for EiffelOpenGL:
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+0>To have installed the glaux.h include file and set your include
path so that your C compiler can find it.</font></li>

<li>
To have installed the glaux.lib library.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<b><font size=+1>4. With which Eiffel compilers/IDEs and on which platforms
does it work?</font></b></h3>
At the moment it has only been tested with ISE bench 4.2f, 4.3 and 4.5
on Windows 95/NT. I hope to be able to port it to SmallEiffel and X Window/Linux
soon.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
5. What is the current version of EiffelOpenGL?</h3>
0.1.0. Version numbering follows the format [Major Version].[Minor Version].[Patch
Level].
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
6. How large is the EiffelOpenGL source code?</h3>
Currently it is comprised of 128 Eiffel classes, 2 C text files and 11
C header files.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
8. Why should I use EiffelOpenGL?</h3>
Well, you can write your OpenGL/GLUT program in Eiffel! That means design-by-contract,
carbage collection (if you want it turned on that is), multiple inheritance
and readable syntax among other things. EiffelOpenGL attempts to use all
the benefits of Eiffel's support for design-by-contract. This enables a
lot of obscure or implicit conditions in the OpenGL and GLUT API can be
implemented in formal contracts and class invariants and thus be made explicit.
<h3>
9. Are there any example programs?</h3>
Yes. Look in the examples directory.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
10. What sort of licensing is EiffelOpenGL under?</h3>
EFFL - The Eiffel Forum Freeware License. See the file "<a href="../forum.txt">forum.txt</a>"
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
11. What are the future development goals of EiffelOpenGL?</h3>
In no particular order:
<ul>
<li>
Ensure platform portability. Primarily Win32 API and X Window. Maybe MacOS.</li>

<li>
Ensure independence of WEL.</li>

<li>
Continue the encapsulation work on OpenGL.</li>

<li>
Continue the encapsulation work on GLUT.</li>

<li>
Drop the encapsulation of GLAUX. GLAUX seems to be unsupported and is not
being further developed.</li>

<li>
Develop more comprehensive example programs. Evaluate performance of EiffelOpenGL.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
12. Can I help with developing EiffelOpenGL?</h3>
Yes you certainly can. Either by just trying out the example programs and
or using EiffelOpenGL and finding bugs and reporting them back to me (paco@enea.se)
or by helping to continue writing the encapsulating code, or by testing
and porting the code to other platforms and compilers. Or by sending me
copious amounts of money or other useful things like a <a href="http://www.nationalguitars.com/styleo.html">National
Style N Reso-Phonic guitar</a>. Just be sure to send me <b>style guide
formatted</b> and <b>compilable</b> code additions or examples and <b>readable
and understandable</b> suggestions for code changes.
