Readme file for the EGLUT multi_sphere program
==============================================

The 'multi_sphere' program is a translation and modification of the GLUT C program 'sphere.c' and displays two different GLUT windows, one with a single lit sphere and the other with two lit spheres. The original 'sphere.c' program can be found at https://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/code/samples/glut_examples/examples/examples.html.
