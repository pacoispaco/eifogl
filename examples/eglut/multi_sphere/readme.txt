Readme file for EiffelOpenGL example program multi_sphere
=========================================================

multi_sphere compiles under SmallEiffel -0.74 + lcc-win32 3.8, but the resulting
binary does not work for some unknown reason. TO BE FIXED!

It works when the SmallEiffel Ace file:

1. Has no trace (yes)
2. Has linker_options: "-subsystem Windows"
