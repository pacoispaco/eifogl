Readme file for the EGLUT egl_primitives program
================================================

The 'egl_primitives' program is a simple program that is used to test the EiffelOpenGL wrappings of the OpenGL primitives. 

Currently it compiles but does not run properly. 

To compile and run
------------------

To compile:

```
$ make egl_primitives
```

To run:

```
$ ./egl_primitives
```

Note: The file 'ise5.ace' is the old EiffelStudio build configuration file and 'build.eant' is a Gobo Eiffel build config file not currently used. 

Exercises
---------

TBD.
