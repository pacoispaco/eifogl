Fixes since release 0.2.0
=========================

1. Fixed bug in "ebuild.py".
   The function "start_building (ebuild_file)" contained references to nonexisting functions
   "e_freeze_message", "c_freeze_message" etc. Corrected to "e_freezing_message" etc.
2. Fixed bug in Ace file for "egl_primitives".
   Added following line to the section external/incude_path:
   "$(EIFOGL)\egl\c\include",
3. Fixed bug in Ace file for "multi_sphere".
   Fixed following line to the section external/incude_path:
   "$(EIFOGL)\egl\c\include",
4. Removed export restriction {NONE} from feature "main_application_callback" in class
   EGLUT_APPLICATION. The export restriction prevented the glut callbacks from calling
   "main_application_callback" in ISE Eiffel 5.1.
5. Improved speed and simplified code in eglut.c after suggestion from Gary M. Smithrud.
