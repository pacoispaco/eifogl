Readme file for EGLAUX (Eiffel wrapping of the GLAUX library)
=============================================================

**NOTE: This is obsolete. Do not use!**

"GLAUX is a very old library that should not be used anymore. Most people who encounter GLAUX are people who see the NeHe tutorials which haven't been updated in years. NeHe uses auxDIBImageLoad() in order to read BMP files. GLAUX is no longer available." (From: https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Related_toolkits_and_APIs).
