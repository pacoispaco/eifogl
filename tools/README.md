README file for eifogl/tools
============================

The directory eifogl/tools contains various tools for developing eifogl.

The tools consist of:

 * h2e.py          A small Python script that can generate Eiffel wrapper 
                   classes based on an C header file.
 * setupenv.sh     A small BASH script to set the environment variables
                   ISE_EIFFEL and EIFOGL. The directories that these
                   environment variables should point to depends of course
                   on how you set up your Eiffel environment and where you
                   clone eifogl.
